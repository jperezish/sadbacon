# [![Sad Bacon](https://github.com/jperezish/sadbacon/blob/master/output/images/sadbacon-site-logo-alt.png?raw=true)](http://sadbacon.com)

This is a comic site I put together to test out using the ruby-based static site generator [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/).


## Various things I used
* Static site generated in [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/)
  * Besides referencing the documentation on the nanoc site, I followed [this tutorial](http://clarkdave.net/2012/02/building-a-static-blog-with-nanoc/) and some info from [this one](http://h3rald.com/articles/take-back-your-site-with-nanoc/) as well.
* [Skeleton boilerplate](http://www.getskeleton.com/) for responsive html/css
* Hosted on [Amazon's AWS S3 service](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
