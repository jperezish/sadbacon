		<p id="article-lead">I&#39;ve been bugged for quite some time now about how time travel is handled in Back to the Future. There&#39;s even a <a title="How Time Travel Works (and doesn&#39;t) in Back To The Future." href="http://www.overthinkingit.com/2009/01/16/how-time-travel-works-in-back-to-the-future/">great analytical read</a> available to help try and dissect the various theories, but I take no comfort in it.</p>

		<p>Maybe the Back to the Future sequels in general just irk me and I&#39;m having trouble thinking about the first one as a stand alone work. I think that&#39;s more likely. I mean the more you go into the well of time travel the more you realize anything&#39;s possible and then you&#39;ve got this big ass rat&#39;s nest of a story and the whole thing is a giant cluster of a parody of itself. <em>CURSE YOU BACK TO THE FUTURE!</em></p>

		<p>Also I&#39;ve been reading a lot of those <a title="My kids love the hell out of these books." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Numeroff#If_You_Give....E2.84.A2">If you lead a monkey to a river</a> books to my kids. We all love the cadence of the stories and I was slightly influenced by that. Maybe I&#39;ll do a more direct interpretation of one of those at some point.</p>

		<h4 class="article-sub">Some production notes</h4>

		<p>I drew the first two comics and some of the first panels of this one many moons ago. The last panels look a bit different. I decided, screw it. It&#39;s a hodge podge thing and bam, it exists.</p>

		<p>I also have a ton of items on my todo list for this site and I&#39;m doing bits and bits when I can. To save time I decided to look for a nice font (on the list: create font from my handwriting, priority: low) to use in the comics as opposed to handwriting them. I&#39;m also doing this because my handwriting isn&#39;t the best and I fall asleep in the middle of inking (yawn...). I thought high school drafting classes using those god damn short, stubby Rapidograph Technical Pens with the fricking eraser shield would&#39;ve turned me into a master class lettering robot... maybe it&#39;s some sort of dormant <a title="A good book I read a while back about a programming daemon." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(technothriller_series)">daemon</a> that has yet to be triggered. <em>WE SHALL SEE</em>. I may end up always using a font since I see that the <a title="A very informative article on lettering." href="http://www.blambot.com/handlettering.shtml">technique for lettering</a> seems to be eerily similar to my past experience in drafting class.</p>

		<p>In the meantime I&#39;m using a nice little font called <a title="This is the font I used in this comic." href="http://www.dafont.com/shaky-hand-some-comic.font">"Shaky Hand Some Comic"</a> by <a title="This is the site for the dude that made the font I used in this comic." href="http://www.typographicdesign.de/">Manuel Viergutz</a>.</p>
